# **Assignment 4: String Formatting using `%()`

# **Instructions:**

# 1. Create a variable `first_name` and assign your first name to it.
# 2. Create a variable `last_name` and assign your last name to it.
# 3. Create a variable `birth_year` and assign your birth year.
# 4. Calculate your age using the formula: `age = current_year - birth_year`, where `current_year` is the current year.
# 5. Using `%()` string formatting, create a string: "My name is %(first_name)s %(last_name)s. I am %(age)d years old."
# 6. Print the formatted string.
